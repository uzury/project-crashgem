          <p>
            Online I go by the handle CrashGem. I've been playing and Game Mastering D&D and other Tabletop games for over 28 years.
          </p><br /><p>
            I love Dungeons & Dragons.
          </p><br /><p>
            I'm currently running 3 ongoing 5e D&D campaigns that meet on a weekly basis, a monthly game, and a West marches game. And the occasional one-shots thrown in to spice things up.
          </p><br /><p>
            I'm currently a player in 1 weekly game:</p><p>
            ❄️ Rime of the Frostmaiden as Hellebore
          </p><br /><p>
            I stream games and game prep everyday over on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/crashgem">Twitch</a> 
          </p><br /><p>
          <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/participant/450846"> I also enjoy running 25-hour super games as fundraisers for the  Extra Life charity</a>.  In the past 5 years, I have raised over $17,000 for Children's Hospital Networks.
        </p><br />
        <p>My goal as a game master is to ensure each and every player “at the table” is having fun. Together we will build stories you will be retelling for the rest of your life.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Expanded:</h2>
        <p>
          I was a play-tester for 5e and have been playing it since release. I am very well versed in the rules. I’ve been using Roll20 for over 6 years, with over 8000+ hours logged, dynamic lighting access, API scripts, and the skill to use them. As a graphic artist, I create custom miniatures, maps, and materials for the games I run.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          As a professional development expert, I am comfortable teaching others new skills (Like D&D and how to use Roll20, for example). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClDTsirj93XEtJn7XGvSnkg"> I'm happy to teach you how to setup and run games on Roll20 virtual tabletop over on my YouTube Channel</a>.  I also spent several years demoing tabletop and wargames at conventions for various companies. I am very comfortable at the gaming table.

          Premium Dungeon Mastering
        </h2>
        <p>
          <br> I started running paid games in April of 2018 after experiencing a few paid games as a player. I was impressed with the commitment and investment of my fellow players and the DM. I wanted to run some campaigns that had that same level of commitment from everyone involved. I've found the literal investment in the group translates directly into how invested everyone is in the campaign's success. </p><p>
          <br>Players in my games gain full access to Legendary Tier DNDBeyond access, which is in turn linked to our Foundry FVTT servers. That means legal, searchable copies of all published books and adventures and robust character-building tools.</p><p>
          <br>Players also gain access to a very active Discord community with character builds, D&D memes, rules discussions, and DM "masterclass" sessions, as well as opportunities to join other games and campaigns run by DMs on my server including our West Marches game, Paradise Vale.</p><p>
          <br>Additionally, dues collected from group members are used to purchase DMGuild add-on supplements for published campaigns, a boosted Discord server, 24/7 Foundry VTT servers, and ensure only the best maps and miniatures. </p><p>
          <br>When I commit to running a campaign, I follow through to the campaign's finale. Nothing is worse than investing your time and energy into a campaign that never reaches its conclusion.</p>
          <br>The following campaigns have been run from start to finish, many taking over a year of weekly sessions!
          <br>Red Hand of Doom, Scales of War, Lost Mine of Phandelver, Storm King's Thunder, HeroQuest, and two instances of Ghosts of Saltmarsh. 
        </p><br>
        Currently, I am running the following games:<br>
        <a href="https://www.crashgem.com/odyssey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Odyssey of the Dragonlords</a> - Monday Nights - FULL<br>

This is one of my first times playing and it was so good I stuck around for 2 years to play a level 1-20 campaign. He loves what he does and it really shows through his discord and storytelling. You will be left feeling spoiled by how amazing Crash is.

                  <span>&ldquo;</span>Suffice to say Crash is the reason I'm still paying to play D&D, his unbridled passion for the game along with his unbounded creativity, tactful wit, and storytelling made me realize what I was missing out on. I consider myself lucky to have found him. He'll give you tenfold what you give him in terms including you and your character into the narrative. It's hard to describe the feeling of having complete and utter trust in your Dungeon Master, I feel like a lot of groups don't have that and that is one reason they fall apart. I've found that his rulings are always fair, I have never felt more joy playing in one of his campaigns, It's the thing I look forward to every week and I hope to continue to tell amazing stories with him in the future. If you get the chance to play a game with Crash, take it...

Instead of sitting around and doing nothing, he made me a ghost and let me haunt the party for the rest of the dungeon. He is quick on his feet and a veteran DM who loves sprinkling in aspects of different games/editions to compliment his games. It's a unique experience I haven't found anywhere else, and a lot of my cherished characters come from his games.

DM resources - this is one point I wanted to touch on because I DM and enjoy Roll20 for its uses but from music to maps, to macros, templates for spells and terrain and all other things... Crash does it all and does it well! If I didn't think I was getting my money's worth, I would have hardly signed up for a second game.

As a player, he is a joy to be around - his experience as a DM shines through and he bring in everyone to help create an unforgettable experience. As a DM, he has shown a lot of passion and respect for the game and for his players. He always has the best interest of everyone in mind and will keep things fun, exciting and deadly. He has a tremendous understanding of the game and has always been fair even in the most stressful of situations. I am incredibly grateful for having found him; as without him, I would have likely given up on finding a quality D&D experience after having many paid campaigns fall through. (cont...)

This year, he has also fostered a community of players and DMs that is both close-knit and fun to be around. He also runs events, one-shots, charity drives and workshops on top of all his ongoing campaigns! I am now genuinely excited to play D&D several times each week and I look forward to playing with Crash and the rest of the community for years to come. Thank you for being so awesome.
